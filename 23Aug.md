**_23 August 2023-Arguments by Levin_**

**Introduction to argument**

- It means to explain why you should believe what one believes

- **Structure Of Argument**

  - Start by stating your conclusion _Can be found by looking for "this" or "therefore"_
  - Premises: Evidence that you present for your conclusion

- Deductive argument:

  - the truth of the premises _guarantees_ the truth of the conclusion **(harder to prove)**

- Inductive argument:

  - Deductive argument: the truth of the premises _guarantees_ the truth of the conclusion

- **_Identify arguments_**

        1. Inductive -> Reasoning with past seasons
        2. Deductive -> Only keyword
        3. Deductive -> Must keyword
        4. Inductive -> Many reasons one might not be responding

- **_Validity and invalidity_**

  - Deductive arguments can be either valid or invalid
  - Validity: the argument’s conclusion necessarily follows from the premises; if the premises are true, then the conclusion logically cannot be false
  - Invalidity the argument’s conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises; the premises can be true, but the conclusion can still be false

  - _Identify Validity_

        1. Valid -> Same as Socrates example
        2. Invalid -> Other workers exist elsewhere
        3. Invalid -> Doesn't need an explanation
        4. Valid -> Can we rewritted with "therefore"

- [ ] **_Inductive Arguments: Strong or Weak_**

  - Cannot be valid/invalid

- **_How to analyze arguments_**
  - Two main questions:
    - Is the argument valid/strong
    - Are the premises true?
  - Common problem: people often overestimate the strength of their conclusions
    - Think about the **"Why?"**
