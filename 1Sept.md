**_Egoism & Altruism_**

- Humans should be more selfish
- Glaucon's flaw is that it's not normative (describing what _should_ be normal)
- > What makes life meaningful?
- ## Ayn Rand -> controversial views on politics and philosophy
  1. Our values comes from us because we are ourselves
  2. Honor this individualism - put yourself first
  3. Altruism does not put yourself first and therefore does not make life valuable
- Ethical arguments for Altruism should be rejected
  - "If a man accepts the ethics of altruism, his first concern is not how to live his life but how to sacrifice it"
  - Living selflessly robs you of your humanity
- For Rand, it’s an either/or situation – I either work for my benefit, or for that of someone else
- Helping other is just a waste of time (Altruism)
- Zero-sum game to get it for myself I have to fight everyone else
  - She thinks of life as a poker game
  - An action is only morally good if one's self benefits from it
  - Self-interest vs Selfishnes
    - Self-interest: I look out for myself, & others when it suits me
    - Selfishness: I only lookout for me
- What are some examples of this?
  - DUI laws
  - Teams can lose but learn
  - Healthcare laws

**_Pojman's Critique_**

- Rand thinks our interests are wrong
- False dilemma -> a way of arguing that takes two bad choices and choosing the "lesser evil"
  - Staying home when sick... it is in everyone's best interest as well as yourself
- Compromise: think of everything and everyone not just ourselves (1 vs everyone)
