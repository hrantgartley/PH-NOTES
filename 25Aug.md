            **_Informal Fallacies_**

- Fallacious Reasoning

  - Fallacy: A way of thinking or arguing that sounds convincing.
  - Three Principles:

    - It should be logically well-framed and should provide good evidence for this.
    - It must be acceptable premises, as determined by the audience.
    - It must be relevant to the conclusion.

  - Relevance Fallacy:

    - present irrevelant informationF
    - Ambiguity Fallacy: use unclear terms.
    - Presumption Fallacy: conclusion through assumptions not stated in the premises.

  - Common Fallacies:

    - Ad Hominem: attacks the other person (insults, etc).
      - Types:
        - Offensive and Circumstantial
          - _Offensive_ to attack a person just because.
          - _Circumstantial_ irrevelant based on current evidence.
      - Example: Car salesman is a type of person to lie to sell the car.
    - Straw Man: Presents an extreme version of the opponent's argument.
      - Example: Example: “My husband said he’d rather stay home than go out tonight. I don’t knowwhy he hates having fun.”
    - Ad Baculum: Literally attack with an attack or a threat to attack (appeal to force).
      - Example: making an offer you cannot refuse.
    - Begging the question: The question is a recursive "because it is so.
    - Appealing to popular opinion: Claims that if the general public agrees with.
      - Example: Everyone knows its okay to lie.
    - Appeal to Pity:
      - Manipulate the audience's emotions into accepting a false conclusion.
        - Example: "I didn't do any work this semester but I want an A".
    - Appeal to ignorance: If it cannot be proven false so it is true.

      - Example: Bigfoot

    - Appeal to Authority: unjustified authority to convince you of the conclusion.
      - Example: Athlete's promoting brands.
        - Make sure that the authority is justified
    - Example: “my roommate, who’s from Georgia, get Chick-fil-A for dinner twice a week. Southern people are obsessed with friend chicken.”
    - Equivocation: uses ambiguous words to vague explain a argument.
      - Example: We paid the amount in taxes that we had to pay
