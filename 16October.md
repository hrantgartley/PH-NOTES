Employers often monitor employees' personal information, because there are few
laws that prevent it

## Sweatshops

Sweatshop labor:

- Developing nations outsource labor for cheaper prices
- Laws do not usually apply to these countries
- Long hours, poor conditions and low safety concerns are not taken seriously

## Respecting Working in Dev Nations

- Respecting person involves more than meeting their basic needs
- Respecting means to protect their freedom (from exploitation)
- The more money they make they should invest more into their workers
  (more power more responsibility)

## Why do mne have moral obligations

- Composed of individuals and individuals have moral obligations
- Since MNE's have the power to make significant impacts, they have the
  obligation to do so

## Workers rights and violations

- Nations may not have legal rights
- Failing minimum wage
- Firing workers for becoming pregnant
- Deontology: disrespecting employees is immoral based on the categorical imperative

## Sweatshops and Coercion

- Coercion: being forced to do something against their will
- Two kinds of coercion: physical and psychological
- Are sweatshops coercive?

## Working Conditions

- Factories have to put their employees in harms way in a number of way
- Chemicals, Machinery, and Fire Hazards
- Arnold and Bowie do not propose specific health codes for MNEs to
  implement

## What is a living wage

- Basic needs met + 10% descretionary income
- Three levels of poverty:
  - Human poverty: lack of basic human capabilities (not clearly defined)
  - Overall poverty: lack of basic non-foods needs (healthcare)
  - Absolute poverty: lack of basic food needs
- MNE have a responsibility to, at least alleviate overall poverty among their employees
  working 48 hour work week

## The choice argument for sweatshops

- People who work in sweatshops freely choose to do so
- Sweatshops may or may not be ethically problematic, but the Choice Argument
  claims that it is wrong for third parties to infringe upon workersâ€™ right to choose

## Foundations of then Choice Argument: Autonomy

- Autonomy: an individuals capacity to set and pursue goals
- Sweatshop workers Autonomously choose their jobs - they assess their opinions
  and pick the best one
- It is generally held that Autonomy ought to be respected & violating it is wrong
  - This is still the case even if violating a person's autonomy in the best interest
- Illegalizing sweatshops would take away the worker's right to Autonomously
  choose and therefore would be wrong

## Foundations of the Choice Argument: Preference

- By taking a job in a sweatshop, a worker shows a preference for that over others
  - Other forms of employment that may be more dangerous/less secure
- Individuals are often assumed to be the best judges of their own interests
  - No one knows you better than you do
- Therefore it would be wrong to interfere with someone demonstrative preference
