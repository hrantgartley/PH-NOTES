**Mackie:** There are not objective moral values

**_Argument from Relativity_**

- There is a difference in accepted morality among different societies and time periods
  - What was different 500 years ago is not okay today (and vise versa)
  - Difference in other cultures or social groups
- People tend to decide that something is moral because that is what they do, not the other way around
  - Example: monogamy (although polygamy is easier with daily life and raising a family)
- Morality is a reflection of a cultures

_"Arguments" based on intuition alone are not valid._

Pathetic fallacy:

- If we don't think something, we think it's bad
- Subjective process
- Convince others to cooperate with laws
