**_The Critque of Moral Relativism_**

[Class Before](./18Sept.md)

- Morality is not black and white but rather a spectrum of grey
- If Morality is made up then what are the negative consequences

- Rejects deontology - Universal Law of good and evil

**Culture 1 believes that action X is right**
**Culture 2 believes that action X is wrong**

- Neither is wrong, because the conclusion does not follow from these premises
  **Counterexample: you believe that the earth is round; I believe that the earth is flat; therefore, the earth is not objectively round or flat**

**_The consequences of relativism_**

- Morality comes from the majority
- We cannot criticize other cultures
  - Example: Age of consent in other countries
- There is no such thing as moral progress -> just a changing culture

**_Cultural differences_**

- A culture who eat beef
- A culture who does not eat beef
  - Why?: a belief of reincarnation or the sacredness of a particular form of life
- Rachels: different customs does not imply a difference in values

**_Moral Isolationism_**

- Idea that we cannot make moral judgements about other cultures
  - They aren't too different from us
  - We cannot understand

**_A Samurai Custom_**

- Tsujigiri "crossroads cut"
- Samurai swords had to be sharp enough to cut a person in two in one stroke
- New swords tested on people in the crossroads
- Is it moral?

  - Some say we cannot judge
  - Culture of foreign to our own and we cannot understand it.

- If we can call out what is right we should also be able to call out what is wrong

  - Praise means nothing without the possibility of criticism

- If we can judge other cultures we should judge our own
