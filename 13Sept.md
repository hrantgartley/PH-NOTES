**Emanuel Kant**

- German.
- Power of human reason..
- One of the most important thinker of the modern era.

**Deontology**

- System of ethics that defines moral conduct as that which
  fulfills some universal duty or obligation
- Applies to every human actions without exception.

**Reason**

- Human capacity for rational thought/logic
- Reason is a unique human trait
- Everything has a purpose
- In part: to give us the capacity for moral decision-making

**Reason and Morality**

- Many rely on emotions to make moral judgements
- Our feelings are too subjective
- No emotions because they vary from person to person
- Instead we should focus on reason as its _Universal_
  - Reason is objective therefore will lead us all to the same conclusion

**Duty**

- We should spend our lives finding out what is right and wrong
- Not focused on outcomes and result
- Morally good: the reason was "I was trying to do what is right"

**Acting from Duty**

- We cannot have selfish motivations
- Example: store owner who charges fair prices
  - If doing from law or duty the action has no moral worth

**Example**

- Imagine that you save a drowning child. You do this not because you care
  about the child, but because you know you will become famous. Kant says
  that this action has no moral worthâ€“ in other words, while it is not bad, it is
  not good either. Do you agree?

**The Categorical Imperative**

- Rule determining how you should act
- Act only in such a way that you could "will" the maxium on which you should act
- Example: lying to make someone fill better -> bad because what if everyone lied whenever it suited them
  - Truth and falsehood becomes meaningless
  - Don't make an exception for yourself

**Why this imperative**

- It is built into our reason
- All rational creatures are bound by this rule

Human Value:

- We should treat others as ends in themselves rather than a means to an end
  - Example: dating
    - only dating someone because you are lonely/wanting gifts.
- We are all uniquely valuable (Lael case - coworkers)

**Anne Frank in the Attic**

- Kant would tell the truth
- A lie is always bad no matter the context
- Lying would disrespect the soldier's humanity
- He is not the one disrespecting the humanity of the Frank family
- No control over the consequences of his lie
